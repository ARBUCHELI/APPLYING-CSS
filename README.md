## Applying CSS

Alejandra has learned CSS and created the desired visual rules to make her website look sleek and polished.

Navigate to the style.css file to take a look at the CSS code that she’s written.

In this file, you will recognize many of the HTML tags that you have been working with — and maybe a few that you haven’t seen yet! CSS contains selectors that specify the HTML elements to which the style should be applied as well as visual rules that specify how that content should be displayed.

Now it’s time to use the HTML link element to apply the CSS file to her existing website. This is done with an HTML link tag. An HTML link tag is often used to create a connection between an HTML file and the CSS file and tells the browser to apply the CSS styles to the HTML.
